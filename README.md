# Interactive 3D Geodesic Dome

This web application displays an interactive 3D geodesic dome. Users can rotate the dome, zoom, and double-click on its faces to add or view notes associated with each face.

## Features

* 3D Geodesic Dome (Hemisphere) rendering using Three.js.
* Mouse/Touch Controls:
    * **Rotate**: Drag with the mouse (left-click) or swipe on a touch device.
    * **Zoom**: Scroll with the mouse wheel or pinch on a touch device.
    * **Pan**: Drag with the right mouse button or two-finger drag (if enabled and not conflicting with rotation).
* **Face Interaction**: Double-click on any face of the dome.
* **Text Notes**:
    * On each triangular face there is the potential to display the note associated with that face. 
    * A modal popup appears upon double-clicking a face.
    * View existing notes for the selected face.
    * Add new notes or edit existing ones.
    * Clear notes for a face.
* Notes are stored in the browser's session (data will be lost on full page reload if not persisted further, e.g., to localStorage or a backend).

## Tech Stack

* TypeScript
* Three.js for 3D rendering and interactions
* Vite for development server and build tooling
* HTML & CSS for structure and styling

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn

## Setup and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd geodesic-dome-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    This command will start a local development server, and the application will typically open automatically in your default web browser. It supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

4.  **Build for Production:**
    This command will compile the TypeScript code and bundle the application for production. The output will be in the `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

5.  **Preview Production Build:**
    To test the production build locally, you can run:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn preview
    ```
    This will serve the `dist` folder.

## How to Use

1.  Once the application is running, you'll see the geodesic dome.
2.  **Rotate**: Click and drag the mouse on the dome.
3.  **Zoom**: Use your mouse scroll wheel.
4.  **Interact with Faces**: Double-click on any triangular face of the dome.
5.  **Manage Notes**:
    * A dialog box will appear.
    * If there's an existing note for that face, it will be displayed.
    * You can type new text into the textarea or modify existing text.
    * Click "Save Note" to save your changes for the current session.
    * Click "Clear Note" to remove any notes for that face.
    * Click the "Ã—" button or outside the dialog to close it.

## Notes on Face Indexing

The `faceIndex` used for storing notes corresponds to the index of the face in the Three.js geometry's `faces` array (for `BufferGeometry`, this is derived from the `index` attribute, usually `triangleIndex = attribute.array[i] / 3`). This index is stable for a given geometry configuration.
